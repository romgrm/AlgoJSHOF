# Journey to the Center of the Array

The aim of this workshop is to get you familiar with the **Higher Order Functions (HOF)** from the Array Prototype. When we begin our programming journey we all start with the usual **for/while** loops as ways of iterating over arrays and through side effect change the original array or something similar. However with iteration comes mutability and the potential for spaghetti code, and it is not what we want. **Higher Order Functions** can solve this problem once you get to know them.

## Main Topics of the Workshop
- Array Methods [Repo Github](https://github.com/guillaumebarranco/array-js-comprehension)
- Object methods 
- Destructuring

The workshop is structured as several refactoring katas. The code given should (normally) work and we documented it to help you understand what the algorithm is suppose to do, then with the power of TDD you will refactor the code using the Array **HOF**.

The aim is not to make to most optimised code in the world, remember, TDD is here to help us. The solutions for the katas are in the branch solution. Please when you go there venture with caution, sometimes it can get quite hairy (the solutions, that is, specially the last ones).

Please, feel free to implement, as you like. The solutions are not absolute. Differents implementations are welcome and can be fun to discuss on. 

To run the tests, please, run this command:

```
$ npm run test
```
